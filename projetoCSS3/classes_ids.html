        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,
        but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour,
        or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum,
        you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
        middle of text.
    </p>
    <p class="azul">
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content
        of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
        more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
        here', making it look like readable English.

        Many desktop publishing packages and web
        page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for
        'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions
        have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected
        humour and the like).
